# Joint-Learning of Upstream and Downstream Task in a Sparse-View Computed Tomography Reconstruction Context

Subject of research at Mines ParisTech 

Objectives: 
- Task 1: 2D-slice reconstruction from X-ray projections 
- Task 2: Segmentation 

Both tasks will be made sequentially using a Multi Task Learning approach with Deep Neural Networks
